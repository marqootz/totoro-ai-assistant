## 🔧 **Voice Setup & Troubleshooting**

### 🎤 **Microphone Setup**

### 🌐 **Internet Connection**
- **Required**: Google Speech Recognition needs internet
- **Fallback**: Use text mode (`--test`) if offline
- **Speed**: Broadband recommended for responsive recognition

### 🗣️ **Speaking Tips**
- **Clear Speech**: Speak clearly and at normal pace
- **Wake Word**: Say "Totoro" distinctly before command
- **Pause**: Brief pause after wake word helps recognition
- **Natural**: Use natural language, no robot speak needed

### 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Microphone Not Working:**
```bash
# Test microphone separately
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; r = sr.Recognizer(); print('Mic test')"

# Check system permissions
# macOS: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone
# Windows: Settings > Privacy > Microphone
```

**Speech Recognition Errors:**
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping google.com

# Test with simpler commands
python main.py --test-voice
```

**TTS Issues:**
```bash
# Test text-to-speech separately  
python -c "import pyttsx3; engine = pyttsx3.init(); engine.say('test'); engine.runAndWait()"
```
