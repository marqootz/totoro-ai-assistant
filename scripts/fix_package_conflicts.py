Create separate virtual environments for each TTS system:

📁 totoro-chatterbox/     (Current - George voice cloning)
   └── chatterbox-tts 0.1.1
   └── numpy 1.26.0
   
📁 totoro-xtts/          (New - Fast neural TTS)
   └── TTS library
   └── numpy 1.22.0
   
📁 totoro-production/    (Hybrid - Best of both)
   └── System TTS (instant)
   └── API calls to other environments

🎯 Benefits:
✅ No conflicts - each env has what it needs
✅ Can switch between systems
✅ Keep George voice cloning working
✅ Add faster alternatives

📋 Commands:
python -m venv totoro-xtts
source totoro-xtts/bin/activate  # or totoro-xtts\\Scripts\\activate on Windows

Manually resolve conflicts by finding compatible versions:

🔧 Fix numpy conflict:
pip uninstall numpy chatterbox-tts TTS
pip install numpy==1.24.0  # Middle ground version
pip install --no-deps chatterbox-tts  # Skip dependency check
pip install --no-deps TTS

🔧 Fix Python syntax conflict:
pip install bangla==0.0.2  # Older version without | syntax

⚠️ Risks:
❌ May break functionality
❌ Requires testing everything
❌ Updates might re-break things

🎯 When to use:
✅ You want everything in one environment
✅ You're willing to test thoroughly

Skip heavy TTS libraries entirely:

🚀 Option A: API-based TTS

- OpenAI TTS (fast, good quality)
- Google Cloud TTS (reliable)

⚡ Option B: Hybrid System
- System TTS for speed (current optimized setup)
- Pre-generated George voice clips for special responses
- API TTS for important messages

🎯 Benefits:
✅ No dependency conflicts
✅ Always up-to-date models
✅ Faster than local neural TTS
✅ Professional quality

✅ No dependency conflicts ever
✅ Easy deployment
✅ Can run on different machines

Based on your setup and needs, I recommend:

🥇 SOLUTION 3: LIGHTWEIGHT HYBRID
Reason: You already have a fast, optimized system working

Implementation:
1. Keep your current optimized Totoro (System TTS)
2. Add ElevenLabs API for George voice when needed
3. Pre-generate some George voice clips for common responses

📊 Results:
• 95% of responses: Instant system TTS (current speed)
• 5% of responses: Perfect George voice (API or pre-generated)
• Zero dependency conflicts
• Zero installation headaches

💵 Cost: ~$5/month for occasional George voice
⚡ Speed: Best of both worlds
🎭 Quality: Perfect when you want it

Step 1: Keep Current Fast System ✅
- Your optimized startup already works perfectly
- System TTS gives instant responses
- No changes needed

Step 2: Add George Voice Options
A) Pre-generate common phrases with Chatterbox
   - "Hello, I'm Totoro assistant"
   - "Done!"
   - "I don't understand"
   - Common responses

B) ElevenLabs API for dynamic George voice
   - Only when specifically requested
   - For important/special responses

Step 3: Smart Voice Selection
- Default: System TTS (instant)
- Special: George voice (when specified)
- Important: API TTS (best quality)

🎮 Usage Examples:
"totoro, what time is it?" → System TTS (instant)
"totoro, say hello in George's voice" → Pre-generated or API
Important announcements → George voice
