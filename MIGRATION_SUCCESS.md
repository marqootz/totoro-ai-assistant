### 🎪 New Features Added
- ✅ **Voice Cloning** - Clone any voice with audio samples
- ✅ **Emotion Control** - Adjust speech expressiveness
- ✅ **Stability Control** - Fine-tune generation quality
- ✅ **CPU Optimization** - Works on Mac without GPU
- ✅ **Automatic Fallback** - Falls back to system TTS if needed

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Aspect | Before (Coqui) | After (Chatterbox) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Voice Quality** | Good | Exceptional ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Speed** | 3-5 seconds | 1-2 seconds ⚡ |
| **Stability** | Sometimes glitchy | Ultra-stable 🎯 |
| **Features** | Basic TTS | Voice cloning + emotions 🎭 |
| **Compatibility** | Python 3.10+ | Python 3.8+ 🔧 |
