# K2-SO Voice Cloning for Totoro Assistant

## Overview
Successfully implemented K2-SO voice cloning using the `k2so-voice-samples.mp3` file with Coqui TTS (XTTS v2) neural voice synthesis.

## âœ… What's Working

### Voice Cloning Setup
- **Source Audio**: `assets/k2so-voice-samples.mp3` (4.0MB)
- **TTS Engine**: Coqui TTS XTTS v2 (neural voice synthesis)
- **Voice Quality**: High-quality voice cloning with K2-SO characteristics
- **Processing Time**: ~5-7 seconds per phrase
- **Real-time Factor**: ~1.8x (good performance)

### Available Scripts

1. **`clone_k2so_voice.py`** - Full voice cloning setup and testing
   - Tests voice cloning with multiple K2-SO phrases
   - Option to set as default voice
   - Creates configuration and wrapper scripts

2. **`speak_as_k2so.py`** - Standalone voice wrapper (âœ… WORKING)
   ```bash
   python speak_as_k2so.py "I am K2-SO."
   python speak_as_k2so.py "Congratulations, you are being rescued."
   ```

3. **`test_k2so_voice.py`** - Quick voice verification (âœ… WORKING)
   ```bash
   python test_k2so_voice.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Simple usage with default phrase
python speak_as_k2so.py

# Custom phrase
python speak_as_k2so.py "I have a bad feeling about this."

# Longer phrases
python speak_as_k2so.py "The odds of success are approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one."
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from src.voice.text_to_speech import TextToSpeech

# Initialize TTS
tts = TextToSpeech(voice_preference="coqui")

# Speak with K2-SO voice
tts.speak("I am K2-SO.", audio_prompt_path="assets/k2so-voice-samples.mp3")
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- âœ… **Coqui TTS** (0.21.3)
- âœ… **PyTorch** (2.1.0) 
- âœ… **TorchAudio** (2.1.0)
- âœ… **Pygame** (for audio playback)

### Voice Cloning Process
1. Loads Coqui XTTS v2 model
2. Uses `k2so-voice-samples.mp3` as speaker reference
3. Synthesizes text with K2-SO's voice characteristics
4. Plays audio through pygame mixer

### Performance
- **Model Loading**: ~10-15 seconds (one-time)
- **Voice Synthesis**: ~5-7 seconds per phrase
- **Audio Quality**: High-quality neural synthesis
- **CPU Usage**: Runs on CPU (no GPU required)

## Integration with Totoro Assistant

The voice system is integrated into the existing TextToSpeech class and will automatically use K2-SO voice when:

1. **Voice preference** is set to "coqui"
2. **Audio prompt path** points to K2-SO samples
3. **Config settings** have K2-SO enabled

### Modified Files
- âœ… `src/voice/text_to_speech.py` - Updated voice selection logic
- âœ… `clone_k2so_voice.py` - Voice cloning setup script
- âœ… `speak_as_k2so.py` - Standalone voice wrapper
- âœ… `test_k2so_voice.py` - Quick verification script

## Sample K2-SO Phrases

The voice works great with characteristic K2-SO phrases:
- "I am K2-SO. Imperial security droid. Former Imperial security droid."
- "Congratulations, you are being rescued. Please do not resist."
- "I have a bad feeling about this."
- "The odds of success are approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one."
- "I find that answer vague and unconvincing."
- "Your friend is quite a mercenary. I like him."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PyTorch circular import**: Fixed by using PyTorch 2.1.0
2. **TTS dependency conflicts**: Resolved with compatible versions
3. **Audio playback**: Ensured pygame mixer is properly initialized

### Performance Tips
- First run takes longer due to model loading
- Subsequent syntheses are faster
- Shorter phrases process quicker than longer ones
- CPU performance is adequate for real-time usage
