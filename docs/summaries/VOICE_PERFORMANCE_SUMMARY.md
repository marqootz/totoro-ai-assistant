   - Potentially faster processing due to simpler audio

2. **K2-SO Voice Advantages**:
   - More diverse voice samples
   - Distinctive character voice
   - Better for specific use cases (droid character)
   - Rich tonal variations

## üßπ Impact of Noise Reduction

### Background Noise Removal Results

#### K2-SO Voice
- **Original RMS**: 0.0385
- **Processed RMS**: 0.0073
- **Noise Reduction**: 81%
- **Processing Speed Improvement**: 30% faster
- **Audio Quality**: Significantly cleaner

#### George Voice
- **Original RMS**: 0.0908
- **Processed RMS**: 0.0358
- **Noise Reduction**: 61%
- **Processing Impact**: Likely improved (not yet tested)

### Why Noise Reduction Helps

1. **Cleaner Voice Patterns**: TTS models work better with clean audio
2. **Reduced Processing Overhead**: Less background content to analyze
3. **Better Voice Extraction**: Neural networks can focus on voice characteristics
4. **Improved Cloning Quality**: More accurate voice replication

## üìà Performance Recommendations

### For Best Performance:

1. **Use Cleaned Audio Files**:
   ```bash
   # K2-SO with cleaned audio (30% faster)
   python speak_as_k2so.py "Your text here" --clean
   
   # Original audio (fallback)
   python speak_as_k2so.py "Your text here"
   ```

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   # Clean audio samples before use
   python audio_preprocessing.py
   ```

3. **Voice Selection Strategy**:
   - **K2-SO**: For character-specific applications, droid voices
   - **George**: For human-like voices, potentially faster processing
   - **Cleaned versions**: Always prefer for better performance

### Processing Time Expectations

| Voice Configuration | Typical Processing Time | Real-time Factor |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| K2-SO Original | 5-7 seconds | 1.8x |
| K2-SO Clean | 3-5 seconds | 1.8x |
| George Original | ~4-6 seconds* | ~1.7x* |
| George Clean | ~3-4 seconds* | ~1.6x* |

*Estimated based on file size and audio characteristics

## üéõÔ∏è Audio Preprocessing Technical Details

### Noise Reduction Methods Used:
1. **Spectral Subtraction**: Primary noise reduction technique
2. **Voice Enhancement**: Normalization and filtering
3. **Silence Trimming**: Removes dead air from beginning/end
4. **Pre-emphasis Filtering**: Enhances voice frequencies

### Processing Pipeline:
```

Voice Enhancement ‚Üí Normalization ‚Üí Cleaned Audio
```

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### Quick Start
```bash
# Best performance with cleaned K2-SO
python speak_as_k2so.py "I am K2-SO." --clean

# Compare original vs cleaned
python speak_as_k2so.py "Original quality."
python speak_as_k2so.py "Cleaned quality." --clean
```

### Integration in Applications
```python
from src.voice.text_to_speech import TextToSpeech

# Use cleaned audio for best performance
tts = TextToSpeech(voice_preference="coqui")
tts.speak("Text", audio_prompt_path="assets/k2so-voice-samples-clean.mp3")
```
